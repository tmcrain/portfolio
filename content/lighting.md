# The Challenge

A startup called Cope hired me to create a **minimum viable product**
for their new idea â€” tracking mental health. It was the first project
where I handled mobile app design, and I was very excited to learn the
intricacies of the iOS platform.

My clients John and Kat have done some preliminary interviews
with psychologists and psychiatrists to get their side of the picture.
They have established a user persona, a business model canvas, and
several startup prep work for the product to take off. My job was to
actually create the experience for their users and make sure they are
represented in the design process.

The design I created was a result of self-started questions,
validating assumptions, benchmarking,  and guerilla testing. I could
have done some more usability studies early in the process, however.
